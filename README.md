## Description

## Acceptance Criteria              
GIVEN a fun geo weather app that allows users to find rainbows locally                   
WHEN I hover my mouse over the rainbow on the homepage.                   
THEN I see details of how to use the Rainbow Chaser App                   
WHEN I click the rainbow on the homepage               
THEN I am taken to a maps page displaying my current location              
WHEN I view my current location                 
THEN I can see a background image showing my current weather              
WHEN I view my local weather                        
THEN I can see the probability of a rainbow near by based on the background image                    
WHEN I look at pins on my local map              
THEN I can click the pins and see my communities photos of the local rainbow             
WHEN I see a rainbow             
THEN I can add a photo and pin to my local map to share location details of said rainbow
